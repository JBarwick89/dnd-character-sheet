# dnd-character-sheet

A tool to allow you to create a custom character class for use in old-school D&D/OSR rpg games (Credit to Cavegirl Games. Original post here: [I did MATHS to the LotFP classes](http://cavegirlgames.blogspot.com/2019/01/i-did-maths-to-lotfp-classes.html)). Also includes a character creator that allows you to generate characters using one of your classes.
